## Why use freya? 

I have a good old noname netbook in use since 2011.
Intel Atom N570(1.66), 2048, 320, WiFi, BT, Cam, 5300mAh it's still worked about 4 hours on batt from 4 year ago.
In 2015 XP x32 or Win7 x32 + chrome + antivirus make me cause to weep tears of blood then i use it.
Freya is fast and being based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, supported until April 2019... that's all.
